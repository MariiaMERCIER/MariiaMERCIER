### Hi, I'm Masha (or Mariia) ðŸ‘‹ 

After 5 years of experience in the building industry I decided to move to the Digital world. I started by myself in the DesignUX and wanting to continue more in the Front-end I decided to train in JavaScript Full Stack with Le Reacteur ðŸš€ . (and yes, I can do backend with Node.js ).


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a junior front-end developer with a lot of ideas and motivation for learning and evolving in this area. I code in JavaScript in Next.js framework, using React or React Native bibliotheques. 

- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ I am Ukrainian and I speak French, Ukrainian, Russian and English.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: mariia.mercier@outlook.fr.
